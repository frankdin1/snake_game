# snake_game

This is code for the classic Nokia game in which you have a snake that gets longer as it eats and dies if it toushes itself or the walls of the game. The code from the snake game comes from a tutorial on youtube that I followed and modified slightly by adding a pause function and implementing directions with directional arrows as opposed to letter keys.
