# snake_game

This is code for the classic Nokia game in which you have a snake that gets longer as it eats and dies if it touches itself or the walls of the screen. The code comes from a tutorial on youtube that I followed and modified slightly by adding a pause function and implementing directions with directional arrows as opposed to letter keys.
